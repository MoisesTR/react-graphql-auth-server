# React Ottawa Talk - React/GraphQL Auth

This is the backend for my talk at React Ottawa on authentication in React + GraphQL apps. The front end can be found [here](https://github.com/chenkie/react-graphql-auth). It needs to be run separately.

To run the app:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be served at `localhost:4000`.
